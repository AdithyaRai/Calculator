# Calculator
To create a simple calculator in C++, you start by including the `<iostream>` library for input and output and writing a `main()` function. You declare variables to store two numbers, an operator, and the result. The program prompts the user to enter the first number, an arithmetic operator (+, -, \*, /), and the second number. Using conditional statements like `if-else` or a `switch` case, the program checks which operator was entered and performs the corresponding calculation. It also includes a check to avoid division by zero. Finally, it displays the result using `cout`. The code is then compiled and run to allow the user to perform basic arithmetic operations interactively.
